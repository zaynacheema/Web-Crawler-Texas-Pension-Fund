# Pension Plan Investment Committee Web Crawler

## Background

Every quarter, there are nearly 15,000 hours of pension plan investment committee meetings that influence $4 trillion in assets under management (AUM). These meetings contain valuable, often undiscovered insights that can lead to significant opportunities for investors. For example, one of our partners identified a $25 million private debt opportunity within the first 20 minutes of using our platform.

This project aims to address this opportunity by extracting actionable guidance from these meetings. Our goal is to help investor sales teams raise funds more effectively by providing real-time insights from allocators. As part of this initiative, the startup, Osmosis, is developing a solution to automatically collect relevant content from identified sources.

## Goal

The function of these Web Crawlers is to automate the process of retrieving video links from Texas pension fund websites. These links will be used to obtain transcriptions of the meetings, which can then be analyzed to uncover actionable insights.

## Web Crawler Overview

This web crawler is a prototype developed during my software engineering internship. It performs the following tasks:

- **Extracts Video Links**: The crawler navigates through specified Texas pension fund websites to locate and extract video links for public plan investment committee meetings.
- **Automates Retrieval**: By automating the extraction process, the crawler helps streamline the collection of video content for subsequent transcription and analysis.
- **Prototype for Automation**: This prototype serves as a foundational tool for the startup's broader goal of automating transcription processes for their clients, ultimately aiding in fund-raising efforts.
